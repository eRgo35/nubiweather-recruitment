# Backend

In this directory you'll find backend starters for the application. You can choose any technology you like, but we've provided couple of starters in different technologies to help get you up and running.

## What we expect from you?

Build simple API that uses https://www.weatherapi.com/ to show current weather in 2 cities: Gliwice and Hamburg. The application can be built using any technology you like.
You should expose at least 2 endpoints:

1. `/realtime-weather` - should return current weather in Gliwice and Hamburg
2. `/forecast-weather` - should return forecast for next days in Gliwice and Hamburg

Those are basic requirements, but feel free to add more features if you like, however don't spend too much time on it - max 8 hours.

## Guidelines for backend:

1. Clean and readable code (don't get too fancy, we're looking for clean and readable code)
2. Usage of modern backend technologies
3. Usage of best practices (we want to see how you structure your code)
4. Usage of version control system (git)
5. Usage of provided API (we want to see how you use it)
6. Saving data in runtime or `optionally` in preferred database (we want to see how you handle data)
